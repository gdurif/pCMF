Description: Routines for probabilistic count matrices factorization (pCMF). 
    Generalization of PCA to zero-inflated and over-dispersed count data, 
    based on Gamma-Poisson factor model and variational inference framework.
    pCMF is specifically designed to analyze single-cell expression data 
    (scRNA-seq).
